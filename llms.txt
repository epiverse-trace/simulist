# *simulist*: Simulate line list data

[simulist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/simulist) is an R package
to simulate individual-level infectious disease outbreak data, including
line lists and contact tracing data. It can often be useful to have
synthetic datasets like these available when demonstrating outbreak
analytics techniques or testing new analysis methods.

[simulist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/simulist) is developed at
the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious
Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases)
at the [London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/) as part of
[Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

## Key features

[simulist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/simulist) allows you to
simulate realistic line list and contact tracing data, with:

⏳ Parameterised epidemiological delay distributions  
🏥 Population-wide or age-stratified hospitalisation and death risks  
📊 Uniform or age-structured populations  
📈 Constant or time-varying case fatality risk  
📋 Customisable probability of case types and contact tracing
follow-up  

Post-process simulated line list data for:

📅 Real-time outbreak snapshots with right-truncation  
📝 Messy data with inconsistencies, mistakes and missing values  
📒 Censor dates to daily, epi- and iso-weekly, yearly and other
groupings  

## Installation

The package can be installed from CRAN using

``` r
install.packages("simulist")
```

You can install the development version of
[simulist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/simulist) from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# check whether {pak} is installed
if(!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/simulist")
```

Alternatively, install pre-compiled binaries from [the Epiverse TRACE
R-universe](https://epiverse-trace.r-universe.dev/simulist)

``` r
install.packages("simulist", repos = c("https://epiverse-trace.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

## Quick start

``` r
library(simulist)
```

A line list can be simulated by calling
[`sim_linelist()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/simulist/reference/sim_linelist.md).
The function provides sensible defaults to quickly generate a
epidemiologically valid data set.

``` r
set.seed(1)
linelist <- sim_linelist()
head(linelist)
#>   id          case_name case_type sex age date_onset date_reporting

```

However, to simulate a more realistic line list using epidemiological
parameters estimated for an infectious disease outbreak we can use
previously estimated epidemiological parameters. These can be from the
[epiparameter](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/) R
package if available, or if these are not in the
[epiparameter](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter/) database
yet (such as the contact distribution for COVID-19) we can define them
ourselves. Here we define a contact distribution, period of
infectiousness, onset-to-hospitalisation delay, and onset-to-death
delay.

``` r
library(epiparameter)
```

``` r
# create COVID-19 contact distribution
contact_distribution <- epiparameter::epiparameter(
  disease = "COVID-19",
  epi_name = "contact distribution",
  prob_distribution = create_prob_distribution(
    prob_distribution = "pois",
    prob_distribution_params = c(mean = 2)
  )
)
#> Citation cannot be created as author, year, journal or title is missing

# create COVID-19 infectious period
infectious_period <- epiparameter::epiparameter(
  disease = "COVID-19",
  epi_name = "infectious period",
  prob_distribution = create_prob_distribution(
    prob_distribution = "gamma",
    prob_distribution_params = c(shape = 1, scale = 1)
  )
)
#> Citation cannot be created as author, year, journal or title is missing

# create COVID-19 onset to hospital admission
onset_to_hosp <- epiparameter(
  disease = "COVID-19",
  epi_name = "onset to hospitalisation",
  prob_distribution = create_prob_distribution(
    prob_distribution = "lnorm",
    prob_distribution_params = c(meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.5)
  )
)
#> Citation cannot be created as author, year, journal or title is missing

# get onset to death from {epiparameter} database
onset_to_death <- epiparameter::epiparameter_db(
  disease = "COVID-19",
  epi_name = "onset to death",
  single_epiparameter = TRUE
)

To simulate a line list for COVID-19 with an Poisson contact
distribution with a mean number of contacts of 2 and a probability of
infection per contact of 0.5, we use the
[`sim_linelist()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/simulist/reference/sim_linelist.md)
function. The mean number of contacts and probability of infection
determine the outbreak reproduction number, if the resulting
reproduction number is around one it means we will likely get a
reasonably sized outbreak (10 - 1,000 cases, varying due to the
stochastic simulation).

***Warning***: the reproduction number of the simulation results from
the contact distribution (`contact_distribution`) and the probability of
infection (`prob_infection`); the number of infections is a binomial
sample of the number of contacts for each case with the probability of
infection (i.e. being sampled) given by `prob_infection`. If the average
number of secondary infections from each primary case is greater than 1
then this can lead to the outbreak becoming extremely large. There is
currently no depletion of susceptible individuals in the simulation
model, so the maximum outbreak size (second element of the vector
supplied to the `outbreak_size` argument) can be used to return a line
list early without producing an excessively large data set.

``` r
set.seed(1)
linelist <- sim_linelist(
  contact_distribution = contact_distribution,
  infectious_period = infectious_period,
  prob_infection = 0.5,
  onset_to_hosp = onset_to_hosp,
  onset_to_death = onset_to_death
)
head(linelist)

```

In this example, the line list is simulated using the default values
(see
[`?sim_linelist`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/simulist/reference/sim_linelist.md)).
The default hospitalisation risk is assumed to be 0.2 (i.e. there is a
20% probability an infected individual becomes hospitalised) and the
start date of the outbreak is 1st January 2023. To modify either of
these, we can specify them in the function.

``` r
linelist <- sim_linelist(
  contact_distribution = contact_distribution,
  infectious_period = infectious_period,
  prob_infection = 0.5,
  onset_to_hosp = onset_to_hosp,
  onset_to_death = onset_to_death,
  hosp_risk = 0.01,
  outbreak_start_date = as.Date("2019-12-01")
)
head(linelist)

```

To simulate a table of contacts of cases (i.e. to reflect a contact
tracing dataset) we can use the same parameters defined for the example
above.

``` r
contacts <- sim_contacts(
  contact_distribution = contact_distribution,
  infectious_period = infectious_period,
  prob_infection = 0.5
)
head(contacts)
#>               from               to age sex date_first_contact
#> 1     Kevin Sablan Kelcee Goldsmith  75   f         2022-12-29
#> 2     Kevin Sablan  Itzel Ontiveros  33   f         2022-12-30
#> 3 Kelcee Goldsmith          Alex Wu  46   m         2022-12-25
#> 4 Kelcee Goldsmith   Xavier Kennedy  53   m         2022-12-27
#> 5 Kelcee Goldsmith   Kimber Nemecek  81   f         2022-12-29
#> 6 Kelcee Goldsmith     Samuel Stott  89   m         2022-12-28
#>   date_last_contact was_case         status
#> 1        2023-01-03     TRUE           case
#> 2        2023-01-03    FALSE under_followup
#> 3        2023-01-04    FALSE under_followup
#> 4        2023-01-03     TRUE           case
#> 5        2023-01-02     TRUE           case
#> 6        2023-01-05     TRUE           case
```

If both the line list and contacts table are required, they can be
jointly simulated using the
[`sim_outbreak()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/simulist/reference/sim_outbreak.md)
function. This uses the same inputs as
[`sim_linelist()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/simulist/reference/sim_linelist.md)
and
[`sim_contacts()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/simulist/reference/sim_contacts.md)
to produce a line list and contacts table of the same outbreak (the
arguments also have the same default settings as the other functions).

``` r
outbreak <- sim_outbreak(
  contact_distribution = contact_distribution,
  infectious_period = infectious_period,
  prob_infection = 0.5,
  onset_to_hosp = onset_to_hosp,
  onset_to_death = onset_to_death
)

## Related projects

This project has some overlap with other R packages. Here we list these
packages and provide a table of features and attributes that are present
for each package to help decide which package is appropriate for each
use-case.

In some cases the packages are dedicated to simulating line list and
other epidemiological data (e.g. {simulist}), in others the line list
simulation is one part of a wider R package (e.g. {EpiNow}).

- [`{LLsim}`](https://github.com/jrcpulliam/LLsim) simulates line list
  data using a stochastic SIR model with a fixed population with
  observation and reporting delays. Line list data is generated in two
  steps, 1) the SIR model simulates the outbreak (`simpleSim()`), 2) the
  outbreak data is converted into a line list (`createLineList()`).
- [`{simulacr}`](https://github.com/reconhub/simulacr) uses a branching
  process model to simulate cases and contacts for an outbreak. It
  simulates transmission of infections using other epidemiological R
  packages
  ([epicontacts](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epicontacts/) and
  [distcrete](https://github.com/reconhub/distcrete)) to parameterise
  and plot simulated data.
- [`{epidict}`](https://github.com/R4EPI/epidict) is a package that can
  be used to simulate outbreak data, including line lists, in a DHIS2
  format, and survey data that mimics the format by Kobo, using the
  function `gen_data()`. In addition, MSF outbreak data are available in
  this package as data dictionaries for Acute Jaundice Syndrome,
  Cholera, Measles and Meningitis, accessible through the function
  `msf_dict()`.
- [`{EpiNow}`](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow) - a now
  deprecated R package - includes the `simulate_cases()` and
  `generate_pseudo_linelist()` functions for generating line list data.
- [generative-nowcasting](https://github.com/adrian-lison/generative-nowcasting)
  is a set of R scripts and functions to perform epidemiological
  nowcasting. There are [functions to simulate line list
  data](https://github.com/adrian-lison/generative-nowcasting/blob/bf48e027e82ce9d42de468d0b708d010253b7475/code/utils/utils_simulate.R)
  within the repository, but the repository is not (and does not
  contain) an R package. Functions can be sourced. Cases are simulated
  with a renewal process and the simulation can incorporate
  epidemiological delays and ascertainment.

If there is another package with this functionality missing from the
list that should be added, or if a package included in this list has
been updated and the table should reflect this please contribute by
making an [issue](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/simulist/issues) or
a [pull request](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/simulist/pulls).

Other R packages for simulating epidemic dynamics can be found in the
*Epidemic simulation models* section of the [Epidemiology CRAN task
view](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Epidemiology).

Some packages are related to {simulist} but do not simulate line list
data. These include:

- [`{outbreaks}`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=outbreaks) an R
  package containing a library of outbreak data sets, including line
  list data, for a variety of past and simulated outbreaks, e.g. Ebola
  and MERS.
- [`{ringbp}`](https://github.com/epiforecasts/ringbp) an R package to
  simulate cases using an individual-level transmission model with
  contact tracing.
- [`{epichains}`](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains) an R
  package with functionality to simulate transmission chains using a
  branching process model.

The {outbreaks} package is useful if data from a past outbreak data or
generic line list data is required. The {ringbp} and {epichains}
packages can be used to generate case data over time which can then be
converted into a line list with some manual post-processing.

Another package for creating messy data is the
[{messy}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=messy) package. This can be
used, either independently or in combination with
[`messy_linelist()`](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/simulist/reference/messy_linelist.md),
to create messy line list and contacts data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  In this context *Parameterised with epi distributions* means that
    the simulation uses epidemiological distributions (e.g. serial
    interval, infectious period) to parameterise the model and the
    parameters of these epi distributions can be modified by the user.

2.  *Explicit population size* refers to the simulation using a finite
    population size which is controlled by the user for the depletion of
    susceptible individuals in the model.

3.  We define *Actively maintained* as the repository having a commit to
    the main branch within the last 12 months.

4.  *Unit testing* is ticked if the package contains any form of
    testing, this can use any testing framework, for example
    [{testthat}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat) or
    [{tinytest}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tinytest).
