This vignette outlines the design decisions that have been taken during the development of the {simulist} R package, and provides some of the reasoning, and possible pros and cons of each decision.

This document is primarily intended to be read by those interested in understanding the code within the package and for potential package contributors.

## Scope

The {simulist} package aims to simulate data on infectious disease outbreaks, primarily line list data, but also contacts data. Each of these output types have an associated exported function: `sim_linelist()` and `sim_contacts()`. There is also a function to simulate and output both of these data types, `sim_outbreak()`. This latter function is useful for interoperability with the [{epicontacts} R package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=epicontacts) (see [visualisation vignette](vis-linelist.html)), and provides linked line list and contacts datasets, which are common in outbreaks, such as the MERS dataset within the [{outbreaks} R package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=outbreaks).

## Output

The simulation functions either return a `<data.frame>` or a `list` of `<data.frame>`s. This consistency across functions of a well-known data structure makes it easy to understand for users.

## Design decisions

- When using age-stratified risks of hospitalisation and deaths (see [Age-stratified hospitalisation and death risks vignette](age-strat-risks.html) for details) there is an interaction between function arguments. The `<data.frame>` that defines the age-stratification in `hosp_risk`, `hosp_death_risk` and `non_hosp_death_risk` arguments gives the lower bound of the age groups. The upper bound of the age groups is derived from the next lower bound, but the upper bound oldest age group is defined by the upper age given to the `population_age` argument. This interaction of arguments is not ideal, as it can be more difficult to understand for users (as outlined in [The Tidy Design book](https://design.tidyverse.org/independent-meaning.html#whats-the-problem)), however, the interaction does not change the interpretation of each argument which would be more convoluted. This design decision was taken when we changed the structure of the `<data.frame>` accepted as input to the `*_risk` arguments from having two columns for a lower and upper age limit, to a single column of lower age bounds. This change was made in [pull request #14](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/simulist/pull/14) and follows the design of [{socialmixr}](https://github.com/epiforecasts/socialmixr/blob/main/R/contact_matrix.R) for defining age bounds. The newer structure is judged to be preferred as it prevents input errors by the user when the age bounds are overlapping or non-contiguous (i.e. missing age groups).

- The column names of the contact relationships (edges of the network) are called `from` and `to`. Names of the contacts table match {epicontacts} `<epicontacts>` objects. If the column names of the two contacts provided to `epicontacts::make_epicontacts()` arguments `from` and `to` are not `from` and `to` they will be silently renamed in the resulting `<epicontacts>` object. By making these column names `from` and `to` when output from `sim_contacts()` or `sim_outbreak()` it prevents any confusion when used with {epicontacts}. This naming is also preferred as they are usefully descriptive.

- Exported functions that simulate data use the naming convention `sim_*()` (where `*` is the placeholder). Internal functions that simulate have a dot (`.`) prefix (e.g. `.sim_internal()`). Functions that create fixed data structures (i.e. data factory functions) have the naming convention (`create_*()` or `.create_*()`).

- Exported post-processing functions, i.e. those that are applied to the output of `sim_linelist()`, use the naming convention `*_linelist()`. Where the `*` placeholder is a verb or adjective, e.g. `messy_linelist()` or `truncate_linelist()`. This naming convention makes it clear that the functions operate on a line list `<data.frame>` and tries to minimise namespace conflicts e.g. `messy()` function from the [{messy}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=messy) package.

- The use of a `config` argument in the simulation function is to reduce the number of arguments in the exported functions and provide as simple a user-interface as possible. The choice of what gets an argument in the function body and what is confined to `config` list is based on preconceived frequency of use, importance and technical detail. That is to say, settings that are unlikely to be changed by the user or if they are changed require an advanced understanding of the simulation model are placed within the `config`, and given default values with `create_config()`.

- Input checking of the `config` list takes place within the call stack of exported `sim_*()` functions when certain elements of the `config` list are used, and not in the `create_config()` function. Therefore, it is possible to create an invalid `config` list with `create_config()`. An example of throwing an error from an internal function of the simulation is if `config$network` is not `"adjusted"` or `"unadjusted"`, or is `NULL` it will error in `.sim_network_bp()`.

- The column names of the line list data produced by `sim_linelist()` and `sim_outbreak()` matches the tag names used in the [{linelist} R package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=linelist) (an [Epiverse-TRACE R package](https://github.com/epiverse-trace)). This is for continuity of design more than any functional reason. The line list data from {simulist} functions is not tagged _sensu_ [{linelist} tagging](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/linelist/articles/linelist.html). There is an inconsistent use of _hospitalisation_ and _admission_; in the simulated line list it is `date_admission`, but internally the package uses hospitalisation (e.g. `.add_hospitalisation()`). This is because I think _hospitalisation_ is more descriptive but `date_admission` is used by {linelist}.

- {simulist} implements its own branching process model (`.sim_network_bp()`) which tracks contacts of infectious individuals. This is a simple random network model, but for future versions of {simulist} we will make the code modular in order to accept other simulations models. This will remove the burden on {simulist} to simulate from a range of model types.

- The `sim_linelist()`, `sim_contacts()` and `sim_outbreak()` do not have arguments that change the dimensions of the `<data.frame>` returned by the functions (or in the case of `sim_outbreak()` a list of two `<data.frame>`s). Instead, we recommend modifying the line list or contact tracing data after the simulation, and provide a vignette to guide users on common data wrangling tasks in `wrangling-linelist.Rmd`. Not including arguments that can remove or add columns to the output `<data.frame>`s reduces the complexity of the functions; and by limiting the simulation function arguments to only parameterise, and not change the dimensionality of, the simulated data, the package is more robust to being used in pipelines or other automated approaches, where the data needs to be predictably formatted.

- Several parts of the {simulist} codebase use indices for determining which individual are infected, allocation to vectors, and other uses. R's subsetting (`[`) can use logical vectors or numeric vectors, but in {simulist} these are differentiated by the names `*_idx` for variables holding a `numeric` vector of indices, and `*_lgl_idx` for a `logical` vector of indices. This makes it safer and more readable to call functions like `sum()` or `which()` on index vectors.

## Dependencies

The aim is to restrict the number of dependencies to a minimal required set for ease of maintenance. The current hard dependencies are:

* {stats}
* [{checkmate}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=checkmate)
* [{english}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=english)
* [{epiparameter}](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter)
* [{randomNames}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=randomNames)

{stats} is distributed with the R language so is viewed as a lightweight dependency, that should already be installed on a user's machine if they have R. {checkmate} is an input checking package widely used across Epiverse-TRACE packages. {english} is a lightweight, (hard) dependency free package which used to converted integers to words. {epiparameter} is used to easily access epidemiological parameters from the package's library, the package is currently unstable and actively developed, however, by using it in another package it can inform the development path of {epiparameter}. {randomNames} provides a utility function for generating random names for case and contact data. The functionality could be replicated in {simulist}, however the {randomNames} package is maintained and contains a range of name generation settings which warrants its use as a dependency.

The soft dependencies (and their minimum version requirements) are:

* [{incidence2}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=incidence2) (>= 2.1.0)
* [{epicontacts}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=epicontacts) (>= 1.1.3)
* [{knitr}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitr)
* [{ggplot2}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2)
* [{rmarkdown}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rmarkdown)
* [{spelling}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spelling)
* [{testthat}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=testthat) (>= 3.0.0)

{knitr}, {rmarkdown}, are all used for generating documentation. {spelling} and {testthat} are used for testing the code base. {ggplot2} is used for plotting within the vignettes. {incidence2} and {epicontacts} are used in vignettes to demonstrate interoperability with downstream packages, with a focus on data visualisation.
